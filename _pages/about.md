I’m a Research Engineer passionate about building AI systems that support human creativity and visual communication. I work at the intersection of Computer Vision, Computer Graphics, and Machine Learning, specializing in generative modeling for 3D scenes and images. My research focuses on creating tools that help people generate, edit, and manipulate visual content in ways that align with human intent. I’m particularly interested in how large generative models can empower users to create complex 3D content they can guide and control. I graduated from the [University of California, San Diego](https://cogsci.ucsd.edu/) in Cognitive Science (Machine Learning & Neural Computation), with minors in Mathematics and Data Science.

I currently work as Research Staff at the [Stanford Cognitive Tools Lab](https://cogtoolslab.github.io/) with [Prof. Judy Fan](https://profiles.stanford.edu/judith-fan), studying how people engage in creative tasks and interact with AI systems. I lead large-scale web experiments and develop platforms that collect multimodal datasets to benchmark human and AI performance and uncover patterns in human-AI collaboration, generating insights that guide the design of AI tools for creative workflows.

Previously, I was a Research Scientist/Engineer Intern at [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com/) with [Dr. Matheus Gadelha](http://mgadelha.me/), where I developed methods to generate 3D scenes with single images using various foundation models. I also worked at the [Visual Computing Group @ Brown University](https://visual.cs.brown.edu/) with [Prof. Daniel Ritchie](https://dritchie.github.io/), developing 3D scene generation systems that leverage LLM program synthesis.
